PROBLEMS AND APPLICATION
========================
Providence City Data is often not up to date in regards 
to pothole reports. Waze data concerning potholes and 
other road conditions is more current and updated every 2 
minutes. Our web application pulls current pothole report 
information from the Waze API and presents this data on 
a map of Providence. Ultimately we hope to push this data 
to the City of Providence Department of Public Works, 
alerting them of current road conditions.

FUNCTIONALITY AND DEMO
======================
We were able to procure pothole report data and present
the data in a map of the City of Providence. We were
unable to obtain an API key from the City of Providence
to allow our data to be reported to them. This was due,
in large part, to it being the weekend; but our logic is 
primed and ready for this functionality to be implemented.
